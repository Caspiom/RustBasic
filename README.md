# Rust Hello Lessons

This repository contains several Rust modules, each created with `cargo new`, covering fundamental Rust concepts. All modules are organized as subdirectories within this single repository (not as Git submodules), making it easy to manage and learn from multiple lessons in one place.

## Lessons Included

- **Data Types**
- **Functions**
- **Borrowing**
- **Constants**
- **Ownership**
- **Variables Mutability**

Each module is self-contained and demonstrates practical examples of the respective Rust concept.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Enter any lesson directory:
   ```sh
   cd <lesson-directory>
   ```
3. Build and run with Cargo:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

> **Note:**  
> Each lesson is a separate Cargo project. There are no Git submodules; all modules are regular subdirectories for easier management.
